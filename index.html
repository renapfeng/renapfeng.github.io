											<h3>About Me</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Hi! I'm an undergraduate ECE student at Princeton, graduating May 2026. 
									    I am pursuing minors in Computer Science, Optimization & Quantitative Decision Science, 
										and Portuguese Language & Culture. I am seeking new opportunities to learn and contribute 
										to cool projects in Computer Architecture, RTL Design, Hardware Security and any related fields. 
										I am passionate about engineering, learning languages, education, and giving 
										back to my community, all of which can be reflected in my coursework, internship 
										and research experience, TA roles, and my volunteer/extracurricular activities. 
										Please scroll through to learn a bit more about me. Thanks for stopping by :D.</p>

								<h4>Science Olympiad</h4>
								<p>
									I competed in Science Olympiad on the regional, state, national, and invitational levels for seven years. It was quite literally my life.
									Building contraptions and testing them gave me so much joy, and Science Olympiad fostered in me a love for engineering and creativity that 
									has only grown more and more over time. I aim to stay involved with the organization for the rest of my life, volunteering to provide other 
									kids like me the opportunities to build and design and develop a deep love for science!

								<h4>Language & Translation</h4>
								<p>In my free time, I love learning languages! I am proficient in Spanish, intermediate in Portuguese, and conversational in Mandarin Chinese.
									I self-studied Spanish for fun during the pandemic and yearned to continue my language learning journey at Princeton. I chose Portuguese for its proximity to Spanish
									and richness in culture as it is spoken worldwide. In learning Portuguese, I went to Portugal and Cape Verde through the Princeton in Portugal program in Summer 2023. I also received the Prêmio Machado de Assis 
									for excellence in advanced undergraduate Portuguese courses in Spring 2025. Learning languages has been one of my most fulfilling pastimes. I love immersing myself in new cultures 
									and conversing with other people.
